(1) The default parameters in this assignment perform a convolution on a
    4096x4096 input using a 5x5 filter and a 32x32 input tile.

    (a) What are the dimensions of the output tile?
	Note in this 5x5 sqyare the filter_radius = 2.5 grounded to 2 in both the x and y dimentions.
        input_tile-2*filter_radius=output_tile
	The output tile is the input tile - the cells on the boundaries, which is input tile - 2 multiplied by input radius
        32 - 2 *2 = 28 cells per axis
        then The dimensions of the output tile are (28, 28)

    (b) What is the total number of ghost cells for the entire input?
	Since the entire input is 4096 x 4096. Then the gost cells or halo cells on the boundaries added around the input is (4096+2*2)^2 - 4096^2
        = 32784 cells

(2) Assume we used a rectangular 5x7 filter instead. The convolution is still
    performed on a 4096x4096 input using a 32x32 input tile.

    (a) What are the dimensions of the output tile?
	Apply the same logic done in 1-a where we reoved the outer level of input cells as they aren't involved in the computation of the output tile, but with a rectangle 5x6\
	Note in this rectangle that is 5x7 the filter_radius.x = 2.5 grounded to 2 and filter_radius.y will be 3.5 grounded to 3.
		In the x dimension:
        		input_tile.x-2*filter_radius.x=output_tile.x = 32-2*2 = 28 cells in width
        	In the y dimention:
        		input_tile.y-2*filter_radius.y=output_tile.y =32-2*3 =26 cells in length

        Therefore, the dimentions of the output tile is (28,26)

    (b) What is the total number of ghost cells for the entire input?
	Since the entire input is 4096 x 4096. Then the gost cells or halo cells on the boundaries added around the input, and since we are dealing with a rectangular shape:
     	(4096+2*2)*(4096+3*2)-4096^2 = 40984 ghost cells
