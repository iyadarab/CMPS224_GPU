The kernels in this assignment with the default parameters set perform a
histogram operation on an image with dimensions 4096x4096 to produce a
histogram with 256 bins. Assume the kernels are configured with 1024 threads
per block. What is the maximum number of atomic operations that may be
performed on global memory for each of the following kernels?

(1) The unoptimized kernel with no privatization in shared memory or thread
    coarsening.

    

(2) The kernel with privatization in shared memory but without thread
    coarsening.

    

(3) The kernel with both privatization in shared memory and thread coarsening
    with a coarsening factor of 64.
